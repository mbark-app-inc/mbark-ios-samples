# Paywall example
A simple example of an mbark paywall. This project integrates a remotely configured paywall into an 
IAP transaction flow. It includes an in-app purchase button that triggers a subscription purchase. 
This example can be extended to provide navigation to additional mbark screens depending on the 
purchase status or transaction result.
