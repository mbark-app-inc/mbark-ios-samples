# Tieback example
A simple example demonstrating mbark's tiebacks. Tiebacks are event handlers that help the mbark  
SDK delegate parts of a user flow to a host app. In this example, a tieback event is generated by an 
mbark view and is used to display an alert.

Steps to add a tieback
1. create an `MbarkActionHandler` in your project that adds a 'tieback' identifier to a handling closure.
2. In mbark's Screen Builder, assign this identifier to a Tieback Action on an interactive component.
3. Launch the app.
